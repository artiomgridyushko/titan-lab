Wholesale online store

This project is a website for the wholesale of goods. The JSON format was used to store information about products, which is ideal for creating a small database of products.

Main Features

Data storage in JSON format: A JSON file is used to store information about products. This makes it easy to manage and change the product range.
Integration with Telegram: Work was carried out with a Telegram bot and a chat where orders from customers are sent. This provides a convenient and instant way to place orders.
